# albums

- [download nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- run npm i
- add directories representing individual albums to `public`
- DO NOT ADD INDIVIDUAL IMAGES
- the first alphabetical file name in each "album" will be its image on the home page
- move the .desktop entry to ~/Desktop
- make sure the Exec path points to this directory
- consider creating a sym link directory from your pictures directory to the 'public' directory housed in this project
- consider locking down this ip address if long term use is planned [example here](https://kb.netgear.com/25722/How-do-I-reserve-an-IP-address-on-my-NETGEAR-router)
- [make a tiny URL](https://tinyurl.com/app) and then convert to QR code for easy sharing in the home.
