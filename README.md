# albums

- [download nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- run npm i
- add directories representing individual albums to `public`
- the first alphabetical file name in each "album" will be its image on the home page
- npm start runs the server
- npm live runs a nodemon live server allowing albums to be added without stopping the server
- ipconfig /all (windows) to find the server's ip 192.168.....etc
- ip a OR ifconfig (linux) 
- consider locking down this ip address if long term use is planned [example here](https://kb.netgear.com/25722/How-do-I-reserve-an-IP-address-on-my-NETGEAR-router)
- [make a tiny URL](https://tinyurl.com/app) and then convert to QR code for easy sharing in the home.
